            <h2>Team Introduction</h2>
            <p>The plugin was developed by Team CS from the University of Queensland's Deco3801 course. 
               Because the six members of the team are all from the University of Queensland computer science major, so named Team CS. 
               Jiaxing Lin, with a major in cyber security, offers expertise in security advice and has experience in prototype design. 
               Yinghong Zheng brings skills in HTML, CSS, and web browser design and application. Nian Liu, knowledgeable in both cyber security 
               and user-base evaluation, also contributes experience in prototype design. Shuyi Yang has experience in creating human-computer 
               interaction games and developing websites with basic functions. Xiaohan Zhang, who majors in data science, excels in managing 
               database-related tasks and has design experience. Lastly, Yuyi Sun is proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PS software, 
               and is skilled in using Live2D for modeling. All of the above members contributed to the development of the project.</p>

        <section class="design-intent">
            <h2>Original Intention of Design</h2>
            <p>In today's digital landscape, where the internet serves as the primary source of news and information, misinformation and fake news have 
               become increasingly prevalent. This project introduces a browser extension prototype designed specifically for Google Chrome to help 
               users identify and avoid unreliable content, encouraging the consumption of fact-based and relatively objective news articles and publications.</p>

            <p>By leveraging artificial intelligence, this extension evaluates news reliability through multiple dimensions, such as source credibility, 
               content accuracy, logical consistency, and content style, providing real-time feedback to users on the trustworthiness of the articles 
               they read (including article credibility scores and explanations for each dimension). In addition, the extension can generate long-term 
               statistics for analytics and show users how consumption patterns and opinions change over time.</p>

            <p>This innovative solution addresses a critical problem in the modern media ecosystem: the proliferation of misinformation. It empowers users, 
               especially university students, to navigate the complex information environment more discerningly. Research indicates that nearly 99.7% of 
               students engage with news regularly, highlighting the need for tools that help them critically assess the information they consume. By promoting 
               awareness of how online content shapes opinions and providing insights to help users make more informed choices, this extension aims to combat 
               misinformation effectively while fostering a more discerning, informed readership.</p>
