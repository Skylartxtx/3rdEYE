                <p>Welcome to <a href="aboutus.html" class="highlight" id="navigateToAbout">3rdEYE</a>. Before you start using our plugin, we need your consent for the collection and processing of your data.</p>

This involves personalizing content, improving our services, and ensuring the security of your data. As part of our commitment to privacy, all data is stored locally on your device, ensuring that it does not leak or get exposed to unauthorized parties. This local data is also used for long-term analysis to help us better understand your usage patterns and improve the plugin’s functionality over time as your needs evolve.</p>
                <p>The types of data we may collect include:</p>
                <ul>

                <p>Data is collected through your interaction with the plugin, and other technologies. This data will be stored, analysed, and used as outlined in this policy to enhance your experience and optimize the plugin's performance.</p>
                <p>Certain data collection is optional. While providing optional data can enhance your experience, it is not mandatory.</p>
                <p>We have implemented robust security measures to protect your data from unauthorised access and potential breaches. Your data will not be shared with third parties, and we ensure it remains securely on your device.</p>
